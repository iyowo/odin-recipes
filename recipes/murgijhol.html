        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The jhol in murgir jhol, refers to the runniest form of sauce in Bengali cooking. This chicken curry recipe is all about freshness of ingredients. It does away with everything but the essential. There is no tempering the oil with whole spices, no tomatoes and green chillies, none of the usual spices such as coriander and cumin, and no garnishing with coriander leaves. Which means that the few ingredients that do go in, have to be fresh if you would like to achieve the best results.</p>
