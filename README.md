# odin-recipes
This is a basic recipe website that I am building following The Odin Project foundation course.
Here I will be demonstrating the HTML skills I have learned thus far. Using basic html boilerplate and embedding image and absolute or relative links are some of the things I will be using. There will also be ordered and unordered list.
Without CSS and Javascript this website will probably not have much interactivity but that will be changing as I progress further down the course.
This is the readme for now until I come back again to apply css and other things.
