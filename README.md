# odin-recipes
This is a basic recipe website that I am building from what I have learned from The Odin Project foundation course.
Here I will be demonstrating the HTML skills learned thus far. Using basic html boilerplate and embedding image and absolute or relative links are some of the things that will be used. There will also be ordered and unordered list.
Without CSS and Javascript this website will probably not have much interactivity and life, but that will be changing as I progress further down the course.
This is the readme for now until I come back again to apply css and other things.
